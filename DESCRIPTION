Description: Discrete choice models are implemented as mixed-effects
  baseline-category logit models to analyze the variation in habitat selection
  of moving animal over seasonal and diurnal scales. Specifically, changes
  in habitat use with respect to habitat availability can be investigated leading to  
  functional response curves that can be fitted using Hollingâ€™s formulas.
