# FunResp
## Multicategory logit models for habitat selection analysis including functional response

Discrete choice models are implemented as mixed-effects
  baseline-category logit models to analyze the variation  of habitat category use 
  of moving animal over various temporal scales. Specifically, changes
  in habitat use with respect to habitat availability can be investigated leading to  
  functional response curves that further can be fitted to Holling's types.
